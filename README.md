# NPX BUSINESS CARD
This my NPX card unique style to connect with me directly via console or terminal

üëá just hit 
```bash
npx manish_kumar
```
And get to know me in unique style.

**A significant amount of time and effort went into building and designing this iteration of the npx card, and I'm truly proud of the result! All I ask in return is for you to give this project a star ‚≠ê and refrain from claiming this work as your own. Thank you! ‚ô•**
